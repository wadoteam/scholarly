        <h1>Abstract</h1>
        <p>
            Wado project aims to construct and manage an ontology with information about web development. Informations
            that will be included in ontology varies from programming languages and IDEs to specific algorithms and
            architecture patterns. The design of ontology aims a modular approach, such that new knowledge in different formats can
            easily extend it. Also, project includes a interface which allows a user to search information about web development using
            natural language. The main architectural propose is to link information from different sources and to infer new data from that
            information.

        <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
        <p>Web semantics represents a new step in the evolution of web and the use of the huge amount of information
            from World Wide Web. Ontologies with help from reasoners can save information and the semantic links
            between them.
            A lot of domains are represented under an ontology which grow in time and offers new ways of understanding a
            domain and its links with others. Computer science is definitely a domain which deserve a comprehensive ontology.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="objective">
        <h1>2. Objectives</h1>
        <p>
            In order to create an ontology that saves semantic data about computer science domains, a few points must
            be taken into consideration:
			<ul>
				<li>
					what is the ideal architectural design for creation of a maintainable, rich in information and easy to
					extend ontology
				</li>
				<li>
					which concepts must such an ontology save through its classes, properties and instances
				</li>
				<li>
					how can it take advantage of reasoner inference to find new links between information especially between
					data come from different sources and different formats
				</li>
				<li>
					what sources of data can be used to create such an ontology
				</li>
				<li>
					how can a user retrieve information from such an ontology in the easiest way
				</li>
			</ul>
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="architecture">
        <h1>3. Architecture</h1>
        <p>
            The architecture of the ontology must allow different sources of data(like a REST API, a GraphQL API or even an existing
            ontology) with different formats(like json, turtle etc.). To achieve modularity it will be used
            a set of design patterns specific for ontologies. Also, not only ontology must be modular, but entire
            project as well. Because of this, an architecture based on micro-services will be used.

			The ontology uses data from <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.github.com/v4/">
                <strong>GraphQL GitHub API</strong>
            </a> that is linked under WADO ontology classes.

            design <a target="_blank" href="http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:AlignmentODPs">Aligment

            <aside typeof="schema:WPSideBar"><i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                OntologyDesignPatterns is a project from Association for Ontology Design & Patterns which propose is to
                create a portal where web semantic community can share, discuss and certify design patterns specific
                for good and reusable ontologies.
            </aside>
        </p>
        <p>
            Aligment of data sources under Wado ontology is made following <strong>Composition over Equivalence
            Principle.</strong>
            The problem of modular ontology design is that the number of subconcept is not know
            and the name of concept as well.The common approach is making classes which representing a new concept,
            equivalent but, when the number of classes grow is difficult to add new class( this means to modify existing
            classes to
            be equivalent with new class). Because of this, composition over equivalence is choose to bo main principle
            for linking
            data. So, classes of WADO ontology will be defined to represent different representation of same concept.
            For
            exemple
            WADO class <code>wado:ProgrammingLanguage</code> will represent <code>GitHub language concept</code> which will be created after a GraphQL query. The client
            will work
            only with WADO classes so different datasources search will be a transparent process.
            Also properties from <a href="#schema">FOAF and RDFs</a> will be used to represent relation between classes
            from different ontologies and discover new relation from merging classes with same URI.

            Another alignment design pattern which will be used is <a
                href="http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:Normalization" target="_blank">
            Normalization ODP.</a> Following this principle will be defined some axes of ontology (layers). 
			Every layer will have only one parent class. The relations between layers will be
            defined using restrictions not inheritance because this way layers can be independent. Also using
            restriction to establish relations between classes and not using inheritance increase level of inference and
            pass the maintenance to the reasoner.For example, in order to define relation between
            <code>wado:Paradigm</code> and <code>wado:FunctionalParadigm</code> and
            <code>wado:ObjectOrientedParadigm</code> it will be used a universal restriction

				<a target="_blank" href="http://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing

            </aside>
            One of the most important data source for WADO ontology is GitHub that offers GraphQL API v4. 
            <aside typeof="schema:WPSideBar"><i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                The GitHub GraphQL API v4 represents an architectural and conceptual shift from the GitHub REST API v3.
				<br/>
				GitHub chose GraphQL for our API v4 because it offers significantly more flexibility for our integrators. 
				The ability to define precisely the data you wantâ€”and only the data you wantâ€”is a powerful advantage over 
				the REST API v3 endpoints. GraphQL lets you replace multiple REST requests with a single call to fetch the data you specify.

            To achieve all objectives WADO project development can be split in two parts:

            Not only ontology must be modular to obtain independence and modularity but whole project too. Because of
            this
            WADO use a microservices design and define a set of independent modules, independent of each other,
            specialized
            on a certain task. Entire project is construct on the follow microservices:
        <ol>

            In conclusion, an ontology with a powerful impact in computer science development must adopt a architecture
            based on design patterns to remain open to extension, easy to maintain and debug. Also is important to catch
            important aspects of the domain and the relations between them, and define classes as restriction of good
            implemented properties to offer the possibility of a qualitative and quantitative inferred data which, at its
            turn to be interrogated easily in a natural language manner.

			WADO is a project created to help developers to find helpful things in order to use them in their daily activity. Because GitHub is 
			the main source of data, users will have access to a large number of repositories that contain only relevant data including: name of frameworks,
			programming languages, code snippets and even full implementations of some functionalities.
